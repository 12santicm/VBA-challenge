# VBA-challenge
In this challenge we were able to loop through our worksheets to get the following information.
   - Unique ticker symbol
   - Quarterly change
   - Percentage change
   - Total stock volume 
   
As well as creating a script for conditional formatting for our Quarterly/Percentage change. This will allow us to have a good visualization for our data and therefore provide us with an easier reading. 
   
--------------------------------------

We used VBA scripts to reach our goals. Each script contains variables, sets, for loops, strings, integers, etc. 

To add more functionality to our work we add these values (list below) that will allow us to condense all this data set into three important categories

 - Greatest % Increase
 - Greatest % Decrease
 - Greatest total volume

 - Screenshots of the results, (Each worksheet, [Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4])
 - VBA script files
